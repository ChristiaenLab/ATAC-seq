# Ciona ATAC-seq data analysis pipeline
This pipeline is designed for processing of paired-end ATAC-seq.
The pipeline can be run on compute clusters with job submission engines or stand alone machines. Pipeline installation is also easy as most dependencies are automatically installed. The pipeline can be run starting from raw FASTQ files all the way to peak calling and signal track generation.
